# ReadStore R Client (SDK)

r-readstore is a R client (SDK) that lets you easily connect to your ReadStore server and interact with the ReadStore API.
By importing the readstore package in R, you can quickly retrieve data from a ReadStore server.

This tool provides streamlined and standardized access to NGS datasets and metadata, helping you run analyses more efficiently and with fewer errors.
You can easily scale your pipelines, and if you need to migrate or move NGS data, updating the ReadStore database ensures all your workflows stay up-to-date.
