            ReadStore is a platform for storing, managing, and integrating omics data. It speeds up analysis and offers a simple way of managing and sharing NGS omics datasets, metadata and processed data (Processed Data). Built-in project and metadata management structures your workflows and a collaborative user interface enhances teamwork â€” so you can focus on generating insights.

            The integrated web service allows you to retrieve data directly from ReadStore via the terminal Command-Line Interface (CLI) or through Python and R SDKs.
            The ReadStore Basic version provides a local web server with simple user management. For organization-wide deployment, advanced user and group management, or cloud integration, please check out the ReadStore Advanced versions and contact us at info@evo-byte.com.
